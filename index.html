   Politically, Bengal is currently divided between Bangladesh (which covers two-thirds of the region) and the Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura. In 2011, the population of Bengal was estimated to be 250 million,[1] making it one of the most densely populated regions in the world.[5] Among them, an estimated 160 million people live in Bangladesh and 91.3 million people live in West Bengal. The predominant ethnolinguistic group is the Bengali people, who speak the Indo-Aryan Bengali language. Bengali Muslims are the majority in Bangladesh and Bengali Hindus are the majority in West Bengal and Tripura, while Barak Valley contains almost equal proportions of Bengali Hindus and Bengali Muslims. Outside Bengal proper, the Indian territories of Jharkhand, Bihar and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are also home to significant communities of Bengalis.
